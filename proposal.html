        <h2>Problem/Data Domain:</h2>
        <h3>Overview of our topic</h3>
        <p>Our centralized sublease platform seeks to provide solutions for individuals seeking to sublet their spaces and those in search of suitable housing options. Our centralized web application provides a user-friendly and consolidated website where users can access subleasing information at their fingertips.</p>
        
        <h3>Issues of current website</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Withot a feature like a favorite list for housing options, students may find it challenging to bookmark or mark preferences, making it less convenient for them to track and revisit the listings that interest them</li>
            <li>There may be limited search capabilities, hindering students from effectively narrowing down their housing choices.</li>
            <li>The scattered information across different pages might make it confusing for students to identify suitable housing options efficiently.</li>
            <li>Students may face challenges in finding the housing they want due to unclear or insufficient location and contact details provided by the posters.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Existing solutions</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1445495232244090/">Facebook group</a> with over 6,000 members is the most popular way for students to identify suitable housing options. On this platform, individuals can only search without the option to filter tags to find the most suitable room type or price, often causing them to miss out on many opportunities.</p>
        
        <h3>Why a Web app?</h3>
        <p>Searching for housing can be an overwhelming process, especially for students who are navigating this task for the first time where there is not a unified webpage tailored to student housing that university students could browse. Students who lack knowledge about housing results in overpaying for expenses/amenities or a far commute from their educational institution.
            Students currently search for off-campus housing on generic websites where it also lists apartments for people working full-time or having to search specific housing by name. Without the specific filters and features to meet the needs of students it becomes difficult to locate affordable housing with proximity to the educational institution. In addition, there lacks 
            the ability to form a community on housing webpages, without the ability to ask other university students for their experiences, students bring the discussion onto reddit, “ I am looking for budget-friendly places near the university. I am open to sharing my bathroom if that helps lower the rent amount. My budget is $500-$700 monthly.” Thus, the process of searching 
            for housing near campus can become time consuming.
